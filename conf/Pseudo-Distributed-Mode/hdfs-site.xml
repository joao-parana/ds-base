    <!--  If true (the default), then the namenode requires that a connecting
          datanode's address must be resolved to a hostname. If necessary,
          a reverse DNS lookup is performed. All attempts to register a
          datanode from an unresolvable address are rejected. It is
          recommended that this setting be left on to prevent accidental
          registration of datanodes listed by hostname in the excludes
          file during a DNS outage. Only set this to false in environments
          where there is no infrastructure to support reverse DNS lookup.  -->
